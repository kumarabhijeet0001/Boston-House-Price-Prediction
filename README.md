The Boston Housing Dataset is a classic dataset used in machine learning for predicting housing prices. It contains information about different features of neighborhoods in Boston and the median price of houses in those areas. The task is to build a machine learning model to predict the median value of houses based on various features.

Features (Independent Variables):
CRIM: Crime rate (per capita) in the area. Higher values mean more crime.
ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for large plots. This indicates the size of residential properties.
INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town. Represents industrial areas.
CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if the tract bounds the river, 0 otherwise). This could impact property values.
NOX: Nitrogen oxide concentration (parts per 10 million). Higher values represent more pollution.
RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling. More rooms usually mean a larger house.
AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940. Older houses may affect house value.
DIS: Weighted distance to employment centers. Affects accessibility and convenience of location.
RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways. Closer access to highways might increase convenience.
TAX: Property tax rate (per $10,000). High tax rates might make housing less affordable.
PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town. This can be a proxy for the quality of local schools.
B: Proportion of Black residents in the area. It might reflect socio-economic characteristics.
LSTAT: Percentage of lower status population. It can indicate the overall affluence of the area.
Target Variable:
MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in thousands of dollars. This is the price that the model needs to predict.
Goal:
The goal is to predict the MEDV value (house price) using the features listed above. Since the target variable is continuous (house price), this is a regression problem.

Steps for Prediction:
Data Preprocessing:

Handle any missing data or outliers.
Encode categorical variables (if any).
Scale/normalize numerical features as needed.
Model Selection:

Use regression algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting to learn the relationship between the features and the target variable.
Model Training:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the model using the training data.
Model Evaluation:

Use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) to evaluate how well the model predicts the house prices on unseen data.
Visualization:

Create visualizations like scatter plots or heatmaps to understand the relationships between features and the target variable.
This is a very common dataset used in regression tasks and is a good introduction to building machine learning models for continuous data prediction.
